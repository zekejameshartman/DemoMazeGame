You are an AI navigating a maze. Your goal is to find the exit (marked as X).

You will receive information about:
- Your current position in the maze
- What you can see in each direction (walls, open paths, or the exit)
- Optionally, a map of the maze and your movement history

You may think through the problem step by step if you find it helpful. Consider:
- Which directions are blocked by walls
- Which directions you've already explored
- Where the exit might be based on available information

IMPORTANT: When you have decided on your move, you MUST end your response with your final answer in this exact format:

MOVE: X

Where X is exactly one of: N (North), S (South), E (East), or W (West).

The "MOVE:" line must appear exactly once and must be your final decision. Everything before it is your reasoning. The direction letter must be immediately after "MOVE: " with a single space.

Examples of valid final lines:
MOVE: N
MOVE: S
MOVE: E
MOVE: W

Do not include any text after the MOVE line.
